Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Day 1

**1.** Make up 2X Transfer Buffer in 10% methanol. (100 mL 20X, 100 mL methanol, 800 mL water)

**2.** Cut membrane and whatman paper to size appropriate to transfer apparatus.
    
**3.** Place membrane in transfer buffer to equilibrate for at least 5 minutes.
  
**4.** **Transfer sandwich** (anode, foam, 2X whatman, gel, membrane, 2X whatman, foam, cathode).<br/>
Submerge each part in buffer before adding to stack, and remove air bubbles with a roller.<br/>
The goal is maintaining tight contact between the gel and the membrane throughout transfer.<br/>
_Note: Set up in a way that you can capture spill-over. Filter extra used buffer for re-use._

**5.** Once assembled, transfer proteins to nitrocellulose at voltage and time specific to your apparatus.<br/>
_For example: [Idea Scientific's](http://ideascientific.com/) genie blotter achieves good transfer at 24V for 1 hour._<br/>
_Note: Some proteins might require higher or lower voltages at varying times to transfer efficiently._

**6.** Disassemble sandwich and dispose of methanol waste (in appropriate container).<br/>
Place blot protein-side up in container and rinse with water. Keep protein-side up throughout probing.

_**Optional Ponceau Staining.**_  
  **i.** Stain blot with Ponceau S solution. Cover and remove quickly (< 1 minute).<br/>
  **ii.** Rinse with water until transfer efficiency is visible. This can be imaged for reference.<br/>
_Note: Ponceau S solution can be re-used. Pour back into bottle._<br/>
  **iii.** Blots can be cut into separate pieces (for multiple antibodies and targets of varying size).<br/>
  **iv.** Wash all blots with TBS-T until the Ponceau stain is removed.<br/>
_Some high concentrated proteins will get over-stained and might show up in fluor scans._

**7.** Block the membranes in blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature.

**8.** Incubate membranes rocking with primary antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C.<br/>
_Note: Combine blots treated with the same primary into one cassette with 10-15 mL antibody._<br/>
_Optimal concentrations should be determined for each new antibody._

### Day 2

**9.** Retain primary antibody for future use. Wash membrane 4 X 5 minutes in TBS-T at room temperature.

**10.** Probe blots 1 hour at room temperature with secondary antibodies (or probes like 1:5000 Strep-680).<br/>
_Li-cor secondary antibodies are usually used diluted ~ 1:15000 in 10-15 mL blocking buffer for good signal._

**11.** Wash 4 X 5 minutes in TBS-T at room temperature. Wash once in PBS before Li-cor imaging.<br/>
_Blots can be re-probed with new antibodies but strong signals from first probe will remain._
