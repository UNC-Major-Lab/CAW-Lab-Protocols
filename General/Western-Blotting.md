Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1.** Combine 50 parts of Reagent A to 1 part Reagent B to create enough BCA reagent for 400 µl per standard and 200 µl per sample.

**2.** Set up 2 replicates of 10 µl each BSA standard and 2-10 µl of each sample (diluted in 10 µl total buffer) in wells of a 96-well microplate.
  
  *Note: doing replicates of the samples could improve accuracy, but is not always necessary.*<br/>*More important that dilution falls within dynamic range of assay.*
    
**3.** Add 200 µl of mixed BCA reagent to each well. Ensure wells are thoroughly mixed (by 30 sec on plate shaker or multi-channel pipette mixing).
  
**4.** Incubate with lid on at 37 °C for 30 minutes.

**5.** Let plate cool to room temperature. Measure absorbance in a plate reader at 562 nm for all standards and samples.

**6.** Average measurements for each standard and subtract background absorbance (the 0 standard). Plot normalized averages against concentration.

  *A quadratic can be fitted to the curve to calculate sample concentrations, or concentration can be interpolated linearly between two standard points.* 

**Tube method:** The BCA assay can be performed in cuvettes on a spectrophotometer with 10X volumes (100 µl Sample and 2 mL BCA reagent).<br/>This does not require replicates.

**Enhanced Sensitivity:** Incubating at 60 °C for 30 minutes instead can increase the sensitivity, but shrink the dynamic range of the assay. Not usually necessary.
