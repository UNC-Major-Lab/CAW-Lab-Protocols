RNA purification with Trizol
================================================================================
Description: Trizol is a common cell lysis and phase-separating reagent for isolating RNA

Materials:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Cells/nuclei on a plate or in a pellet 
  * [Trizol](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/15596026#/15596026) lysis reagent
  * 75% ethanol
  * Optional for low concentrations: [glycogen](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/10814010#/10814010)

Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1.** Suspend cells in 1 mL Trizol Reagent and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes.<br/>_Note: 1 ml is usually fine for 10<sup>5</sup> - 10<sup>7</sup> cells._

**2.** Add 200 µl of chloroform, mix well and leave at room temperature for 10 minutes
    
**3.** Separate phases at 12,000 x g for 10 minutes at 4 °C, retain the <ins>aqueous</ins> phase (top).<br/>_Note: It is important to not be greedy and avoid the interface (where DNA is) as much as possible._

**4.** Mix samples with 1 volume of isopropanol, vortex 5 seconds and leave at room temperature for 10 minutes.<br/>_Note: For expected low yields, it can help to add 1 µl of carrier glycogen._

**5.** Pellet at 12,000 x g for 8 minutes at 4 °C, remove the supernatant.

**6.** Wash in 1 mL 75% ethanol, spin at 7,500 x g for 5 minutes.<br/>_Note: Pellets in ethanol can be stored long term at -20 °C._

**7.** Remove most of the ethanol, spin down and remove residual ethanol, and then air dry pellets for 5-8 minutes.

**8.** Resuspend in 44 or 88 µl (depending on expected yield) of nuclease-free water in preparation for [DNase treatment](./TURBO-DNase.md).<br/>_Note: DNase treatment is not necessary if RNA is not from a cell or tissue source._
