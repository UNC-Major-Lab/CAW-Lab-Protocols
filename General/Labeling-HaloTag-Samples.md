**HaloTag Labeling Buffer**
  * 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5
  * 150 mM NaCl
  * 2 ÂµM HaloTag fluorescent ligand

HaloTag labeleing can be performed by incubation for 20 minutes at room temperature.

The [AlexaFluor 660](https://www.promega.com/products/protein-detection/protein-labeling/halotag-fluorescent-ligands/?catNum=G8472) ligand can be imaged in the 700 channel of a Li-cor instrument.<br/>This ligand is not cell-permeable, but is useful for SDS-PAGE samples.
