DNA agarose gel
================================================================================
**Description:** DNA separates by charge across a current (surrogate for size as each bp has same charge).<br/>
Intercalating agents label nucleic acids and are visualized in-gel via fluorescence.

Materials:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * **50X TAE:** Mix Tris and EDTA in 700 mL of water until dissolved. Add acetic acid and bring to 1 L.
  <br/>Final 50X solution is 2M Tris, 1M Acetate, 50 mM EDTA, and pH ~8.6.
  
    | Component | Concentration | Quantity | 
    | ---------: | ---------: | :---------- |
    | Tris base | solid | **242**  g | 
    | acetic acid | glacial | **51.7**  mL |
    | EDTA (pH 8.0) | 0.5 M | **100**  mL |  
    | ddH2O || **to total** |
    || **Total** | **1** L |
  
     *Note:Can also add 18.61 g of disodioum EDTA instead of solution*
     
  * Agarose
  * Nucleic acid dye or label, for example:  
    ◦ 5 mg/mL Ethidium Bromide (a 0.5% solution). This is 1000X<br/>
    _Note: EtBr is a carcinogen and must be disposed of properly._   
    ◦ [GelRed Nucleic Acid Stain 10,000X](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/mm/sct123?lang=en&region=US&cm_sp=Insite-_-caContent_prodMerch_gruCrossEntropy-_-prodMerch10-1). Can be used as 20,000X

  * DNA samples (want at least 50 ng per band per sample)
  
  * [6X DNA Loading Dye (NEB)](https://www.neb.com/products/b7024-gel-loading-dye-purple-6x#Product%20Information)
    <br/>*Plenty of substitutes, or standard: 30% glycerol, 0.25% bromophenol blue, 0.25% (w/v) xylene cyanol.*
  
  * DNA molecular weight ladder

Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1. Mix Gel:** Make up 0.8 % Agarose gel mix in 1X TAE (0.8 g in 100 mL).
<br/>*Notes: Can be more or less depending on your eletrophoresis setup.*
<br/>*Make sure the vessel holds about 2.5x your chosen volume (mixture will boil).*
  
**2. Melt agarose:** Heat mixture for 1 minute in standard microwave.<br/>
Pulse heat for 15 seconds at a time, mixing in between, until agarose is fully melted.<br/>
_Wear appropriate PPE. Mixture will be hot._

**3. Add label and pour gel:** Once gel is cool enough to handle with gloved hands, add desired amount of stain and pour gel into cast.<br/>
Add a gel comb with desired number of lanes and disrupt any visible bubbles with a pipette tip.<br/>
Let gel set for 30-60 minutes (will set faster at 4 °C).

**4. Load gel:** Dilute DNA samples and ladder into similar volumes and add Loading dye to 1X final concentration.<br/>
Load each sample into a well.<br/>
_Notes: Try to match buffer conditions in the ladder and samples, as differences can exaggerate how off the size estimations are._

**4. Image gel:** DNA gels are easily imaged on systems using UV transilluminators.
<br/>*Stains absorb highly at ~300 nm (medium wavelength, UVB) and emit at 600 nm (which is detected on the camera).*

**Optional Gel Purification:** DNA can be purified and size selected on a gel.<br/>
Use a razor blade or scalpel to excise the gel slice and purify with commercial [kit](https://www.neb.com/-/media/nebus/files/protocols/t1020_quick_protocol_card_monarch_dna_gel_extraction.pdf?rev=09308c01500f43c6a8589b01845765d9&hash=0FD4350A9DE2AEAC84913DB2A00140AF).<br/>
_3 µg of input DNA (or more) can be visualized by the naked eye with GelRed stain._<br/>
_Mid-range UV can be used to locate bands labeled with EtBr, but too much exposure will damage DNA._
