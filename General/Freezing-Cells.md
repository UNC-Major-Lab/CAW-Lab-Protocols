Freezing Cells
================================================================================
**Description:** Many cell lines can be preserved at -80 °C (long-term) or in liquid nitrogen (very long-term).

Materials:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * DMSO
  * FBS
  * Plates of highly confluent cell line

Equipment Required:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Day 1-4

  * -80 °C freezer or liquid nitrogen storage
  * Vials intended for cryo-storage

Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**1.** Pellet cells and wash 1X with PBS.  
  ◦ _Note: Different cells pellet at different speeds (500 x g for 10 minutes works for HEK293T)_

**2.** Resuspend cell pellets in freezing media (90% FBS, 10% DMSO). Distribute into cryo-vials and immediately place in -80 °C freezer box.  
  ◦ _Note: The amount of cellular material per freeze-down depends on cells. For HEK293T, eight 1 mL vials from three 100 mm plates works well._
  
**3.** If very long-term storage is required, vials can be moced to liquid nitrogen after a day at -80 °C.  
  ◦ _Note: Cells have to "slow-cool" to remain viable when thawed. The air-jacket provided in a freezer box is usually enough to make this happen._
