Preparation of stable cell lines using lentivirus
================================================================================
Description: Prepared virus can insert genes of interest into genome, creating stable cell lines.

[Go To Protocol](#protocol)

Before starting:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [Lentivirus production](./virus-production-HEK293T.md)

Materials:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### All Days
  * Antibiotic-free complete media (DMEM + 10% FBS)

### Day 1
  * 6-well tissue culture plates

### Day 2
  * Polybrene (10 mg/mL)
  * Lentivirus  
  _Note: Virus might be unconcentrated (2X), concentrated (20X), or hyper-concentrated (100X)_
  
### Day 4+  
  * Puromycin (1 mg/mL)

### Day 5  
  * Trypsin (0.25 %)


Equipment Required:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Mammalian cell culture incubator (37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>)

Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Day 1

**1.** In wells of a 6-well, plate 400,000 cells in 2mL of antibiotic-free complete media (e.g. DMEM + 10% FBS) for each infection.<br/>
Plate one no-infection control well (to ensure cell death) and well with only 40,000 cells to act as a parallel parental cell line.

Incubate cells for 24 hours at 37 °C.

### Day 2

**2.** Change to transduction media (DMEM + 10% FBS + **10 µg/mL polybrene**). Incubate cells for at least 1 hour at 37 °C.

**3.** Add 100 µl of concentrated virus to each well (adjust volume based on level of virus concentration). Transduce for 24 hours.
  * _Note: The no-infection control and parental line do not recieve any virus._

### Day 3
**4.** Change to normal complete media (DMEM + 10% FBS)
  * _Note: At this point, treat each well as a different cell line: switch pipettes between wells.</br>Media from these cells chould be treated as virus-contaminated: Do not vaccuum-aspirate and bleach everything it touches before disposal._

### Day 4

**5.** Change virus-infected and no-infection controls to selection media (DMEM + 10% FBS + **1 µg/mL puromycin**). Do not change media on the parental cells.

### Day 5
**6.** Trypsinize cells and transfer all to new 60 mm dishes in 4 mL selection media (DMEM + 10% FBS + **1 µg/mL puromycin**). </br> Split parental line as normal (100 mm dish and antibiotic-free media).

Incubate cells for 24 hours at 37 °C.

### Day 6

**7.** Change media on all cells (maintaining puromycin selection for infected and no-infection control).

### Day 7+
**8.** Monitor cells and split/expand/change media as necessary, maintaining selection.</br>The goal is to generate enough material to make frozen stocks and prepare a validation experiment.
