miniTurbo In-cell Biotinylation
================================================================================
Description: Cell lines expressing miniTurbo protein fusions are fed excess biotin, leading to biotinylation of proteins in close proximity to the miniTurbo protein.

[Go To Protocol](#protocol)

Before starting:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [Stable cell line generation by lentiviral infection](../Lentivirus-Stables/virus-production-HEK293T.md)

Materials:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Day 1-3
  * Cell line stably expressing miniTurbo bait protein or control
  * Cell culture reagents (per your chosen cell line)
    
### Day 3 or 4
  * 50 mM biotin in DMSO
  * Liquid nitrogen for freezing large cell pellets

Equipment Required:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Day 1-4

  * Cell culture incubator (37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> usually)
  * Microcentrifuge (for tubes) or larger centrifuge (for conicals)

Protocol:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Day 1
**1.** Plate cell lines at ~30,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> (about 150,000 cells/mL)
  
  * If preparing for western validation, each cell line (and time point) needs at least a 12-well.
  * For Mass Spec preparation, each cell line needs at least 3 15-cm dishes (5-10 is better, will be split into 2 replicates).

### Day 2 or 3
  
**2.** Change media on cells.
 
   *Note: The goal is to treat with biotin once cells are confluent (Day 3 or 4).* <br/>*Changing the media a day before helps ensure proper volume and cell morphology.*

### Day 3 or 4
  
**3.** Treat cells with a final concentration of 50 µM biotin (from a 1000X 50 mM stock in DMSO).
 
   * For initial Western validation, time points worth testing include 30, 60, and 120 minutes. <br/>A DMSO only control is also necessary.
   
   * For Mass Spec samples, treat for the predetermined optimal length of time for each bait.

**4.** Wash cells 2 times with 0.5X growth volumes of PBS (to eliminate excess biotin).
  
  *Note: Cells are being harvested, no need to use cell culture grade PBS for washing steps.* <br/>*When processing many samples for Mass Spec, just dump media and washes into a waste container to speed up process.*
  
**5.** Scrape cells with ice-cold PBS and combine like samples (for Mass Spec procedure) into single tube.
  
  * For Western validation, pipetting a 0.5X growth volume of PBS onto the sample is usually enough to dislodge and collect cells. <br/>Move to eppendorf tubes on ice.
  
  * For multi-plate MS samples, scrape with ~3-5 mL of cold PBS per 15 cm dish and combine into a 15 mL or 50 mL conical tube on ice. Collect any remaining cells with a single up to 10 mL wash of cold PBS for all plates of single sample and add to that sample's conical tube. 
    * Example: 3 15 cm dishes of one sample could be processed as 3 x 3 mL PBS scrapes + a final 6 mL wash shared between them. This would result in a single full 15 mL conical for the sample.
  
**6.** Pellet cells at 500xg for 10 minutes. Discard the supernatant and freeze cell pellets (or proceed directly to cell lysis).
  
  *Note:For cell pellets for Westerns in eppendorf tubes, pellets can be frozen and stored directly at -20 °C.* <br/>*For larger pellets less than 1 mL of bed volume in conical tubes, placing them directly into -80 °C is sufficient.* <br/>*Pellets larger than 1 mL should be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen before being transferred to -80 °C.*
